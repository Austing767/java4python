        <title>Forgetting to declare your variables</title>

        <p>
            This error occurs because the variable count is being used without being declared first. We know that the variable count is causing the issue because the error message has an arrow pointing at it. Java doesn't recognize count as a known variable in the class Histo, so it throws a "cannot find symbol" error. To fix this, you need to declare count with a proper type before assigning a value to it.
        </p>
        <pre>
            Main.java:7: error: cannot find symbol
                count = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(10);
                ^
              symbol:   variable count
              location: class Main

        <title>Forgetting to use the new keyword to create an object</title>

        <p>
            Here&#x2019;s an example of the error message that occurs when you forget to use the new keyword.
            Notice that the message is pretty unhelpful.
            Java <em>thinks</em> you are trying to call the Method Scanner, but there are two problems.
            First Scanner is not really a method it is a constructor.:
        </p>

        <pre>
            Histo.java:14: cannot find symbol
            symbol  : method Scanner(java.io.File)
            location: class Histo
                data = Scanner(new File("test.dat"));
                ^
        </pre>

            Note: Histo.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations. Note:
            Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
