        <p>
            Conditional statements in Python and Java are very similar.
            In Python we have three patterns:
        </p>
        
        <title>Simple if</title>

        <p>
            In Python the simple if statement is written as:
        </p>

        <program interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <code>
score = 95
if score &gt;= 90:
    print("Excellent work!")
            </code>
        </program>
        <p>
            In Java, this same pattern requires two changes: the condition must be in parentheses <code>()</code>, and the code block must be enclosed in curly braces <code>{}</code>.
        </p>
        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
            public class SimpleIfExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    int score = 70;
                    if (score &lt;= 70) {
                        System.out.println("Needs work!");
                    }
                }
            }
            </code>
        </program>
        <p>
            Once again you can see that in Java the curly braces define a block rather than indentation.
            In Java the parenthesis around the condition are required because it is technically a function that evaluates to True or False.
        </p>

    <section xml:id="if-else">
        <title>if else</title>

            <p>The Java equivalent follows the same syntactical rules as before.</p>
        <program interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <code>
            age = 16
            if age &gt;= 18:
                print("You can vote.")
            else:
                print("You are not yet eligible to vote.")
            </code>
            </program>

        <program language="java">
            <code>
        public class IfElseExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int age = 16;
                if (age &gt;= 18) {
                    System.out.println("You can vote.");
                } else {
                    System.out.println("You are not yet eligible to vote.");
                }
            }
        }
            </code>
        </program>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="elif">
        <title>elif</title>

        <p>
            Java does not have an elif pattern like Python.
            In Java you can get the functionality of an elif statement by nesting if and else.
            Here is a simple example in both Python and Java.
        </p>


        <program interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <code>
grade = int(input('enter a grade'))
if grade &lt; 60:
    print('F')
elif grade &lt; 70:
    print('D')
elif grade &lt; 80:
    print('C')
elif grade &lt; 90:
    print('B')
else:
    print('A')
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
In Java we have a couple of ways to write this
        </p>


        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
public class ElseIf {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
     int grade = 85;
     if (grade &lt; 60) {
         System.out.println('F');
     } else {
         if (grade &lt; 70) {
             System.out.println('D');
         } else {
             if (grade &lt; 80) {
                 System.out.println('C');
             } else {
                 if (grade &lt; 90) {
                     System.out.println('B');
                 } else {
                     System.out.println('A');
                 }
             }
         }
     }
   }
 }
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
We can get even closer to the elif statement by taking advantage of the Java rule that a single statement does not need to be enclosed in curly braces. Since the if is the only statement used in each else we can get away with the following.
        </p>



        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
public class ElseIf {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
     int grade = 85;
     if (grade &lt; 60) {
         System.out.println('F');
     } else if (grade &lt; 70) {
         System.out.println('D');
     } else if (grade &lt; 80) {
         System.out.println('C');
     } else if (grade &lt; 90) {
         System.out.println('B');
     } else  System.out.println('A');
    }
}
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

    <section xml:id="switch">
        <title>switch</title>

        <p>
Java also supports a <c>switch</c> statement that acts something like the elif statement of Python under certain conditions. To write the grade program using a switch statement we would use the following:
        </p>

        <note>
            <p>
                Depending on your knowledge and experience with Python you may already be familar and questioning why we are not using the <c>match</c> statement in our Python examples.The answer is that Unforunately, this book runs its active code examples on Python 3.7, which does not support the <c>match</c> statement. The <c>match</c> statement was introduced in Python 3.10. Below is an example of the <c>match</c> statement simmilar to our grade method.
            </p>
                    <program language="python">
            <title>Match Case example</title>
            <code>
                grade = 100 // 10
                def grading(grade):
                    match grade:
                        case 10 | 9:
                            return 'A'
                        case 8:
                            return 'B'
                        case 7:
                            return 'C'
                        case 6:
                            return 'D'
                        case _:
                            return 'F'
                print(grading(grade))
            </code>
        </program>

        <p>
            The <c>switch</c> statement in Java provides a clean and efficient alternative to chaining multiple <c>if-else</c> conditions, especially when comparing a single variable against several constant values. It supports a variety of data types, including primitive types (<c>byte</c>, <c>short</c>, <c>char</c>, <c>int</c>), their wrapper classes, <c>enumerations</c>, and <c>String</c> (introduced in Java 7). Each <c>case</c> within a <c>switch</c> must be defined using a constant expression, and duplicate <c>case</c> values are not permitted. By default, control flow "<c>falls through</c>" from one <c>case</c> to the next unless a <c>break</c>, <c>return</c>, or <c>throw</c> statement is used to terminate execution. Java 14 introduced <c>switch expressions</c>, enhancing functionality by allowing the <c>switch</c> to return values and eliminating <c>fall-through</c> via the <c>-&gt;</c> arrow syntax. These expressions can even use <c>yield</c> within code blocks for more complex evaluations. Itâ€™s important to note that traditional <c>switch</c> statements do not support <c>null</c> values and will throw a <c>NullPointerException</c> if evaluated with <c>null</c>. As the language evolves, newer versions of Java continue to extend <c>switch</c> capabilities with features like <c>pattern matching</c> and enhanced <c>type handling</c>, making it a more powerful and expressive tool for decision-making in Java programs.

        <program interactive="activecode" language="java">
            <code>
public class SwitchUp {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
     int grade = 85;
     int tempgrade = grade / 10;
     switch(tempgrade) {
     case 10:
     case 9:
         System.out.println('A');
         break;
     case 8:
         System.out.println('B');
         break;
     case 7:
         System.out.println('C');
         break;
     case 6:
         System.out.println('A');
         break;
     default:
         System.out.println('F');
     }
   }
 }
            </code> <tests> </tests>
        </program>

        <p>
The <c>switch</c> statement is not used very often, and I recommend you do not use it! First, it is not as powerful as the <c>else if</c> model because the switch variable can only be compared for equality with an integer or enumerated constant. Second it is very easy to forget to put in the <c>break</c> statement. If the break statement is left out then then the next alternative will be automatically executed. For example if the grade was 95 and the <c>break</c> was omitted from the <c>case 9:</c> alternative then the program would print(out both A and B.)

        <title>Boolean Operators</title>

        <p>
The conditionals used in the if statement can be boolean variables, simple comparisons, and compound boolean expressions.
        </p>

        <p>
Java also supports the boolean expression. <c>condition ? trueValue : falseValue</c> This expression can be used to test a condition as part of an assignment statement. For example <c>a = a % 2 == 0 ? a*a : 3*x -1</c> In the previous assignment statement the expression <c>a%2 ==0</c> is first checked. If it is true then a is assigned the value <c>a * a</c> if it is false then a is assigned the value of <c>3*x-1</c>. Of course all of this could have been accomplished using a regular if else statement, but sometimes the convenience of a single statement is too much to resist.
