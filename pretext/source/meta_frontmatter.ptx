    <p>Welcome to <em>Java for Python Programmers</em>. This short ebook is an ongoing
        project to help Computer Science students who have had one or two
        semesters of Python learn the Java programming language. If you are not
        a part of that audience you may still find this a useful way to learn
        about Java. This book is written using the build on what you know
        philosophy. In order to help you learn Java I will start with a Python
        example and then implement the example in Java. Along the way we will
        examine the strengths, weaknesses and differences between those two
        languages.</p>
    <p>This book does not attempt to replace the many good Java reference books
        that are available, in fact I use this in my course along with
        <url href="https://horstmann.com/corejava/index.html" visual="https://horstmann.com/corejava/index.html">Cay Horstman&#x2019;s &#x201C;Core Java&#x201D; volumes</url>.
        Please feel free to use this book for
        yourself, or if it fits a class you are teaching you are welcome to use
        this as a resource for your own class.</p>
